# Finding Donors for CharityML

## Introduction

Welcome to the Finding Donors for CharityML project! This project is part of the Data Scientist Nanodegree. The goal of this project is to employ several supervised learning algorithms to model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. The objective is to identify people most likely to donate to CharityML.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `census.csv`: The dataset containing census data.
- `example_submission.csv`: An example submission file.
- `finding_donors.html`: The exported HTML version of the Jupyter Notebook.
- `finding_donors.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the project code and analysis.
- `test_census.csv`: A test dataset.
- `visuals.py`: A Python script for visualizing data.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will:

1. Explore the data to understand its structure and characteristics.
2. Preprocess the data to prepare it for modeling.
3. Implement and evaluate several supervised learning algorithms.
4. Optimize the selected model to improve its performance.
5. Interpret the results and provide insights.

## Instructions

1. Open the [`finding_donors.ipynb`](finding_donors.ipynb ) notebook.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to complete the project.
3. Answer the questions marked with **'Question X'** headers.
4. Implement the code marked with **'TODO'** statements.
5. Once you have completed the project, export the notebook as an HTML file and include it in your submission.
